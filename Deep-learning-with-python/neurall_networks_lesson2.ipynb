    "Training a neural network resolves around the following:\n",
    "* *Layers*, which are combined into a network (or model)\n",
    "* The *input data* and corresponding targets\n",
    "* The *loss function*, which defines the feedback signal used for learning\n",
    "* The *optimizer*, which determines how learning proceeds\n",

    "### 2.1.1 Layers: the building blocks of NN\n",
    "\n",
    "A layer is a data-processing module that takes as input one or more tensors and that outputs one or more tensors. Different layers are appropriate for different tensor formats and different types of data\n",
    "processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, simple vector data, stored in 2D tensors of shape *(samples, features)*, is often processed by *densely connected layers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence data, stored in 3D tensors of shape *(samples,timesteps, features)*, is typically processed by *recurrent* layers such as an *LSTM layer*.\n",

    "Image data, stored in 4D tensors, is usually processed by *2D convolution* layers (Conv2D).\n",

    "### 2.1.2 Models: network of layers\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep-learning model is a directed, acyclic graph of layers. The most common\n",
    "instance is a linear stack of layers, mapping a single input to a single output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Loss functions and optimizers: keys to configuring the learning process.\n",
    "Once the network architecture is defined, you still have to choose two more things:\n",
    "* Loss function (objective function)—The quantity that will be minimized during training. It represents a measure of success for the task at hand. Choosing the right objective function is extremely important.\n",
    "* Optimizer—Determines how the network will be updated based on the loss function.It implements a specific variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n"
